\title{Demographic model of introgressive hybridization }
\description{
This model simulates the proportions of parentals,
F1, F2, Fx and backcross (on both sides) individuals for each generation and takes into account the initial frequencies of parentals, the assortative mating among taxa as well as fitness differences.
}
\usage{
demosimhybrid(x,M,F)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{

  \item{x}{
A vector indicating the initial abundances in the population.The vector should sum 1. The order of abundances is: ParentalA, ParentalB, F1, BxA, BxB and Fx
}
  \item{M}{
Matrix assortative mating.The size is 6x6 following the same order tan vector x. By default random mating (all = 1)
}
  \item{F}{
A vector indicating the diferent fecundities of the parentals and hybrids. The vector size is 6 following the same order tan vector x. By default equal fecundities (all = 1)
}
}
\details{
